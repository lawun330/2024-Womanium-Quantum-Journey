# 2024-Womanium-Quantum
I attended `Womanium Quantum + AI 2024` program from June to August. This is my first exposure of in-depth lectures and trainings regarding quantum computing. 
This repository is a reflection of my learning journey as it contains correct solutions and assignments. Furthermore, the repository contains the original notebooks used in lectures and trainings to teach quantum computing concepts. I fixed some bugs from those notebooks and they are here to maintain their versions used in 2024 program.
